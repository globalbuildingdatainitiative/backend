feat: Implement document publication workflow with admin approval

This commit implements the complete document publication workflow with admin approval as specified in the feature specification. The implementation includes:

- State-based project management with six project states (DRAFT, IN_REVIEW, TO_PUBLISH, TO_UNPUBLISH, TO_DELETE, LOCKED)
- Role-based permissions for three distinct user roles (CONTRIBUTOR, REVIEWER, ADMINISTRATOR)
- Complete GraphQL API with new mutations and queries for managing the publication workflow
- Comprehensive test suite following TDD principles with contract tests, integration tests, and unit tests
- Extended data models with state management fields
- Service layer implementation with state transition validation
- Proper error handling and input validation
- Updated documentation and schema definitions

The implementation follows the Test-Driven Development approach where all tests were written first and fail before the implementation was completed. All tests are now passing, confirming the correct implementation of the feature.

Key files modified/created:
- Backend models extended with state management fields
- GraphQL schema updated with new types, mutations, and queries
- Service layer implementation for state transitions
- Comprehensive test suite covering all user workflows
- Updated documentation in specs directory
