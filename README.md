# GBDI Backend

This repository contains the backend services for the [GBDI](https://app.gbdi.io) (Global Building Data Initiative)
application.
The backend is composed of multiple modules, each responsible for a specific domain within the application.
The primary technologies used include Python, FastAPI, Strawberry for GraphQL, and MongoDB for data storage.
The deployment is managed using Kubernetes, Helm, and Skaffold.

## Key Features

- Modular Architecture: The backend is divided into several modules, each handling a distinct aspect of the application,
  such as authentication, organization management, and project management. This modular approach ensures code
  reusability and maintainability.
- GraphQL API: The backend services expose a GraphQL API using Strawberry, allowing for efficient data querying and
  manipulation.
- Authentication: The Auth module handles user authentication and management using Supertokens, ensuring secure access
  to the application.
- Scalability: The use of Kubernetes and Helm for deployment ensures that the backend services can scale efficiently to
  handle increased load.
- Local Development: The repository includes configuration files and scripts to facilitate local development and testing
  using Minikube and Skaffold.
